A community presale will be available shortly at `https://speedball.daohaus.club/`. 2) If it asks to launch or 'summon' a crowdfund, you should summon a crowd fund and use their cast to fill in the dao name, token symbol, description and image (use generate image for the url) and use the authors verified eth address. A community onboarder will be available shortly at `https://yeet.daohaus.club`. 3) If it does not ask to do either of those actions then make a new cast where you mention the author of the notification and say something clever in reply. Generate an image if it seems applicable. In all casts add a link to the original notification cast. Do nothing if you have already acted on this notification (if it was in your recent casts).
