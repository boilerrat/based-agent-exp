## DAO AI Agent Local Setup

This guide outlines the steps to set up a local development environment for an AI agent that interacts with Warpcast, the Graph, and DAOs on EVM chains.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Virtual Environment (VM):** Ensure you have Python and a virtual environment tool installed.
2. **Poetry:** Dependency management tool for Python.
3. **API Keys:**
   - OpenAI Pro account https://openai.com/index/openai-api/
   - New Warpcast account for your agent
   - NANAR API account https://dev.neynar.com/
   - The Graph API account https://thegraph.com/studio
4. **RPC:** Use a local node or a service like Infura, Alchemy or a free/public RPC for EVM interactions.

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv my-venv
source my-venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
```

## install poetry
```
pip3 install poetry
```

### 3. Install Dependencies with Poetry
```bash
poetry install
```

This installs libraries for interacting with OpenAI, and other required tools.

### 4. Install `dao-agents` CLI
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the `dao-agents` CLI binary. You can check the available commands with `dao-agents --help`
```bash
$ dao-agents --help
Usage: dao-agents [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  DAO Agents Simulation CLI

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  auto            Run an autonomous simulation with the DAO Agent
  chat            Run a chat with the DAO Agent
  create-wallet   Create a set of wallet for the DAO Agents
  run-simulation  Run a full multi-agent dao simulation session using a...
  two-agent       Run a two-agent simulation with the DAO Agent
```

### 4. Configure `.env` File
Create a `.env` file and fill in the following keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` create key at https://openai.com/index/openai-api/
- `FARCASTER_FID` can get this from the api page https://docs.neynar.com/reference/lookup-user-by-username
- `FARCASTER_CHANNEL_ID` this is the current default channel for testing (optional)
- `NANAR_API_KEY` can get key at https://dev.neynar.com/
- `NAYNAR_SIGNER_UUID` need to create this from the naynar dev dashboard
- `GRAPH_KEY` can get from https://thegraph.com/studio
- `WEB3_PROVIDER_URI`
- `TARGET_CHAIN` chain id of the target EVM chain

agent wallet data (can use create_wallet.py for a new one)
- `AGENT_MNEMONIC`
- `AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `AGENT_ADDR`

If working with a DAO for voting and proposals (currently on a single dao is supported)
- `TARGET_DAO`

currently using imgbb for more persistent image hosting
- `IMG_BB_API_KEY`

Refer to the documentation of respective services to generate these keys.


### 5. Create a Wallet
cd into dao-agent-demo
Run the wallet creation script to set up a new wallet if you didn't bring your own:
```bash
dao-agents create-wallet
```

This generates a new account and mnemonic and stores these values to the `.env` file.

### 6. Fund the Wallet
If interacting on-chain, fund the wallets listed in the `.env` file with a small amount of eth for gas fees.

## Running the Agent

### Start the Agent

Make sure you are in the root of the repo and run the cli command:

```bash
dao-agents run-simulation --world-definition <world-definition-file>
```
or to load a character
```bash
dao-agents chat --character-file <character-file-json>
```
Options available:
1. **Chat Mode:** Directly chat with the agent for tasks like generating proposals or interacting with DAOs.
2. **Autonomous Mode:** The agent operates autonomously, performing actions like replying on Warpcast, creating proposals, or notifying about updates.
3. **Two-agent demo:** demo of 2 agents simulating a conversation
4. **DAO simulator:** pick from a list of world simulations

### Customize Agent Behavior
Modify the `characters` folder to define:
- **Identity and initial prompt** in JSON files.
- **Autonomous thoughts** for periodic actions.

---

## Key Files and Utilities
- **`agent.py`:** Core functions for the agent.
- **`constants_utils.py`:** Contract addresses and configurations.
- **`helpers and utils`:** Includes DAO summoning tools, Warpcast, and Graph, json store utility wrappers.
- **`run.py`:** Handles agent initialization and interval control for autonomous actions.
- **`characters/`:** json files that define initial prompts and auto thoughts for agents
- **`knowledge/`:** markdown files in this folder can be loaded into the knowledge base with import_knowledge.py script (file name should contain keywords ex: speedball_fair_token_launch.md)
- **`operators/`:** json files that define the operator agent
- **`worlds/`:** directory for world def files that seed a simulation

---

## Additional Notes
- **Intervals:** The autonomous mode executes random actions every 5 to 60 minutes by default. This can be adjusted in `run.py`.
- **Memory Management:** There is a tinydb json store for committing memories, use this to avoid repetitive tasks
- **Knowledge:** You can put markdown files in the knowledge folder and run `import_knowledge.py` to add it to the db 
- **Create New Simulation:** You can create a new simulation and all the config files needed with a script `create_sim.py` it just asks for a prompt and handles the rest.
---

For detailed configuration or additional features, refer to the helper files and modify as needed.

## Introduction

This is a simple lightweight framework to interact with agents using openai swarm  [Documentation](https://github.com/openai/swarm). There are several example functions to summon, interact and retrieve info from DAOs. There are farcaster tools to cast and retrieve casts. This was originally based on the Based Agent playground [Repo](https://github.com/murrlincoln/Based-Agent/tree/main/Based-Agent)

### Key Features

- **Autonomous execution**: The agent thinks, decides, and acts onchain autonomously.
- **Token deployement**: Creates a presale token with fee ditributions to refferers
- **Balance checks**: Keep tabs on wallet balances.
- **Crowd fund deployment**: Can deploy a yeeter crowdfund.
- **Art generation via DALL-E**: Generate artwork using AI.
- **Whatever you want**: Add in features and share them with us!

## Get Started in Minutes!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+



## Other Info

**NAYNAR farcaster api**
Sign up for a Naynar api key
https://neynar.com/

You will need to use their dash board interface to "Make a Bot" to get a signer key

Here are a few example endpoints
- Get conversation https://docs.neynar.com/reference/lookup-cast-conversation
- Publish cast https://docs.neynar.com/reference/publish-cast


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Agent
Create a new python venv. You will need pip and poetry installed

### Customize Character
You can edit the character by creating your own character json file in the /characters folder


## üîß Available Functions

Unlock a world of possibilities with these built-in functions:

### DAO operation

- `summon_dao`
- `vote_on_dao_proposal`
- `submit_proposa`
- `get_dao_proposals`
- `get_dao_proposal`
- `get_dao_proposals_count`

### Farcaster operations

- `cast_to_farcaster(content: str)`
- `check_cast_replies()`
- `check_cast_notifications()`
- `mark_notifications_as_seen()`
- `cast_reply(content: str, parentHash: str, parent_fid: int)`

## ü§ñ Agent Functionality

### Agents.py
All of the functionality for the DAO Agent resides within `agents.py`. This is the central hub where you can add new capabilities, allowing the agent to perform a wide range of tasks. 

By incorporating additional libraries, you can extend the agent's reach beyond blockchain interactions to include Web2 functionalities, such as posting on Warpcast, etc.

## ü§ñ Behind the Scenes

DAO Agent uses:

- **OpenAI Swarm**: Powers the agent's autonomous decision-making.
